name: Modules.URLSession
summary: Wrapper to support iOS's NSURLSession class for background downloads.
description: |
    These APIs are supported on iOS 7 and later.

    The URL session module (`com.appcelerator.urlSession`) provides the application the ability to
    download large content via HTTP while the application is in the background. With this module, you can

      1. Create a URL session and a background download task.
      2. Monitor events to check the progress of the download and session.
      3. Cancel downloads and invalidate sessions.

    URL session events are monitored through the following iOS application-level events:

      * <Titanium.App.iOS.backgroundtransfer>
      * <Titanium.App.iOS.downloadprogress>
      * <Titanium.App.iOS.downloadcompleted>
      * <Titanium.App.iOS.sessioncompleted>
      * <Titanium.App.iOS.sessioneventscompleted>

    These events are monitored as application-level events by using the `addEventListener` method with the
    Titanium.App.iOS namespace.  

    For more information on getting started, refer to the
    [iOS Background Services guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/iOS_Background_Services).

methods:
  - name: createURLSessionBackgroundConfiguration
    summary: |
        Creates a preconfigured session configuration object that can be used to create a URL session for
        performing a background download task.
    parameters:
      - name: indentifier
        summary: Arbitrary string used to identify the session in the events.
        type: String
    returns:
        summary: Configuration object to pass to the <Modules.URLSession.createURLSession> method.
        type: Object

  - name: createURLSession
    summary: Creates a session with the specified session configuration.
    description: |
        If the session configuration was created with the identifier of a existing session,
        then this function would return the pre-existing session.

        The session object keeps a strong reference until your app explicitly invalidates the
        session. If you do not invalidate the session by calling the `invalidateAndCancel` or
         `finishTasksAndInvalidate` method, your app leaks memory.
    parameters:
      - name: sessionConfiguration
        summary: Session configuration object created with the <Modules.URLSession.createURLSessionBackgroundConfiguration>
        type: Object 
    returns:
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object

  - name: finishTasksAndInvalidate
    summary: Invalidates the given session object, allowing any outstanding tasks to finish.
    description: |
        This method returns immediately without waiting for tasks to finish. Once a session is invalidated,
        new tasks cannot be created in the session, but existing tasks continue until completion. Once
        invalidated, references to the events and callback objects are broken. Session objects cannot be
        reused. To cancel all outstanding tasks, call `invalidateAndCancel` instead.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object

  - name: invalidateAndCancel
    summary: Cancels all outstanding tasks and then invalidates the session object.
    description: |
        Once invalidated, references to the events and callback objects are broken. Session objects cannot
        be reused. To allow outstanding tasks to run until completion, call
        `finishTasksAndInvalidate` instead.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object

  - name: backgroundDownloadTaskWithURL
    summary: |
        Creates a download task for the specified URL, within the provided session object and saves the
        results to a file.
    description: |
        Once this function is called, the download starts automatically. The progress of
        the download can be monitored by listening to the `downloadprogress`, `downloadcompleted`,
        `sessioneventscompleted` and `sessioncompleted` events.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object
      - name: url
        summary: URL to download content from.
        type: String
    returns:
        summary: Task's identifier number.
        type: String
